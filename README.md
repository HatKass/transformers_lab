# 🧠 Deep Learning Lab – Transformers: BERT, ELMo, GPT-2

This project is a hands-on Deep Learning Lab exploring transformer-based models for Natural Language Processing using TensorFlow, HuggingFace, and PyTorch.

We focus on:
- 🔡 ELMo: Contextual word embeddings
- 🤖 BERT: Bidirectional language understanding
- ✍️ GPT-2: Text generation
